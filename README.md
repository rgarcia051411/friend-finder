# friend-finder

This program is friend matching based on users answer to the 10 surveys. The user will answer 10 question with values from 1 to 5. When the survey is submitted, it will then compare the user's score to the stored user's score. Whoever has the closest score to the user will be his/her match, and will pop as modal.
